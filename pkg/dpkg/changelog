gbootroot (1.2.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Append field in the ABS now saves state for non-root users.  Before it only
    remembered state if lilo.conf could actually be read, ofcourse, this wasn't
    an option for non-root users.  The beginnings of non-root boot and root_fs
    creation capabilities have been put into place, but haven't been fully
    implemented.  The end result of this is that directories created in
    $tmp are now static for non-root users and now use the userid number to 
    keep track of different non-root users.

  * The author of swim came out with a new version he now calls dswim.  This
    means Debian System Wide Information Manager, but the "d" could also stand 
    for different.  Changes have been made to make_debian to facilitate this 
    much more stable version of swim, and better non-installed package checks 
    have been implemented in make_debian.

  * The control dependencies have been vastly improved, and reflect the change
    from swim to dswim.  Yard_chrooted_tests is now put in a gbootroot specific
    directory since it is unique to gbootroot.

  * The lastest user-mode-linux is included: 2.4.12

  * Updated the documentation, and it includes a better explanation in step 7
    for "How can I test gBootRoot?"

  * Added checks for the existence of ash, lilo, bzip2, and file for the 2 
    disk compression method.
