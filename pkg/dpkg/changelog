gbootroot (1.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated linux and modules to 2.4.17-4um.  Made jffs and jffs2 part
    of the  kernel, and had to comment out the get_mtd_device function
    call in jffs_fm.c  and super.c to accomplish this.  Looking forward
    to more support from the uml  project for mtd devices.
  * Updated to the 20020104 uml tools, this includes port-helper which
    is the new  helper for allowing uml devices to be attached to a
    specified host port.
  * Changed the behavior of the Accept button so that when compression
    is chosen (gzip or bz2) the Root Filename remains the same as
    before.  This is nice because the fs can be remade with the same
    name and re-compressed, rather then appending gz or bz2 to the name.
    Before if the user forget to  delete the ending this would happen:
    root_fs.bz2.bz2.bz2
  * Changed shells for root and user to /bin/sh in passwd-debian,
    passwd.debian and passwd.example.  This is a better idea, and
    assumes sh links to a user defined shell, so if the shell is changed
    the password files don't have to be.
  * Added several new questions to the FAQ, thanks to Liav.
  * Liav Asseraf <liav_a@yahoo.com> points out a problem in 1.3.1.  I
    reply to him with this answer: "Indeed, you have found a bug.
    Bootroot adheres to the  most recent Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
    (2.1); in previous bootroot versions a big chunk of the source code
    was included in /usr/bin/gbootroot, but I  decided to reorganize and
    move most of that code to BootRoot/BootRoot.pm, in  the process I
    also moved a statement which executes before the rest of the program
    does to set up a proper @INC.  What this all means is that gbootroot
    couldn't find the required modules."  This bug has been fixed.
  * Altered tooltip text for the Options entry to recognize that the
    umid needs to be switched in the mconsole box in order for the new
    Linux virtual machine to be controlled via the buttons and the
    mconsole.  The behavior could be  changed to accomplish this
    automatically, but that wouldn't be consistent  with the behavior
    one would expect from the mconsole; anyways the documentation
    already explains to use switch in the mconsole.

gbootroot (1.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a complete interface to the mconsole in the UML Box.  Multiple
    options  can be entered at one time.  Options include: switch so
    that the umid can be  changed to control a different Linux virtual
    machine, sysrq as in  Documentation/sysrq.txt, config and remove for
    devices (ubd?,eth?), reboot  and halt, version to find the version
    of the running uml kernel, and help.
  * Added both a Reboot and Halt button to the UML Box.  Both of these
    buttons  have an interface to mconsole, and provide clean control of
    rebooting or  halting a Linux virtual machine.  When they fail,
    Abort does all the clean-up, but this should be used as a last
    resort.  Both of these buttons initially  parse the Options entry
    for the first instance of umid
  * Added a new stage button in the Yard Box called Copy.  Create is now
    Copy, and the uml_exclusively and genext2fs behavior are handled by
    Create, this is much nicer because a new filsystem type can be
    created without having to wait for everything to be copied again to
    the sources directory.
  * Updated the documentation and graphics to reflect the new changes,
    and provide a new exercise.
  * If the sources created from the template had a symlink in them from
    a previous creation, you couldn't just press create again without
    symlink() complaining  (for instance, for genext2f and the new
    uml_exclusively).  This has been fixed.
  * Compiled 2.4.16-2um linux and modules to specification for
    root_fs_helper. Makefile properly edited to copy over the config
    used.  Ext2, cramfs, minix, reiserfs, and romfs are built-in to the
    kernel.
  * Got rid of the complete lock-up when large files are compressed,
    ofcourse, users won't want to try to compress more than one format
    at the same time,  because the logic will get skewed.  In the future
    may make this OO.  Added  some verbosity to tell when the process
    has begun and finished.
  * Established logic for Filesystem Box based on ownership.  Defaults
    need to be different dependending on the user.  Normal users
    probably never will want to preserve permissions, but they may want
    to toggle off UML Exclusively to create different filesystem types
    when <= 8192 fs_size. Root users may want to turn off Preserve
    Permissions to create a root only filesystem, and the may want to
    toggle between creating root filesytems via loop devices or UML to
    allow different filesystem types.
  * Added UML Exclusively and Preserve Permissions check boxes to the
    Filesystem Box.  Esc closes, changed table size, and layout,
    responds to return, and submit button defaults.
  * Put Jeff Dikes UML.pm in BootRoot, and changed it to BootRoot::UML,
    added one change to allow no password.
  * The auto-magic test for uClibc was only testing for busybox, this
    has been fixed.

gbootroot (1.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a README for users installing from the source package.
  * Removed the enforcement of the yard suffix rule for templates,
    because it  was never really documented; however, it is still a nice
    rule to follow  despite that it is not enforced anymore.
  * Added an archictecture-dependent replacements repository directory.
  * Fixed the freezing behavior for particularly large templates, like
    the ones produced by make_debian, and make_debian-X11.  However,
    overly large buffers in the verbosity box still hog cpu in a big
    way.  The best procedure for now is to open and close the box
    between stages.
  * Made the termcap check just a warning if terminfo or termcap don't
    exist, If a terminfo directory is found, linux will need to exist or
    the test will  return error.  This is better because the root
    filesystem can still work  if this information doesn't exist.  A
    minority of gettys will fail if they  use termcap or terminfo, but
    this check was removed from the chrooted tests  several months ago
    for the reason just cited.  Note: check_getty_type_call  was removed
    from Yard.pm, but exists in chrooted tests without the termcap
    check.  Also, added a close which was missing.
  * Removed an unnecessary check from the fstab test, and improved a
    regexp  which was failing if tabs were used in the fstab.
  * State is saved for all check buttons when the yard box is opened and
    closed.  Deciding whether to save state between invocations of
    gbootroot via a file.
  * Moved the Changelog from within gbootroot to a Changes file in
    /usr/share/doc/gbootroot, because it is getting quite large.
  * Improved the sizing of the UML box.
  * Added New Template (Alt-N) capability to the Yard Box.
  * Added several new FAQ questions,  added a lot more information on
    "How do I use gBootRoot?"  Updated the graphics for the
    documentation.
  * Updated to version 2.4.16 of user-mode-linux.
  * The Yard Box has new check buttons which allows the parsing behavior
    of the nss and pam configuration files to be turned off and on
    (default).
  * Pam.conf and pam.d/{service names or *} can now be checked for their
    specified service modules.  The service modules are located either
    in /lib/security or /usr/lib/security and included with the file set
    if they  are found on the host system.  The modules are then checked
    for their  dependencies which are included if they haven't
    previously been specified. Therefore, the user no longer needs to
    specify pam modules and dependencies  in the template if the pam
    parsing option in turned on.   Nsswitch.conf can now be checked for
    the service modules it specifies.  The service modules pertaining to
    the host systems libc6 are located and  automatically included.  The
    modules are then checked for their  dependencies which are included
    if they haven't previously been specified. Therefore, the user no
    longer needs to specify nss modules and dependencies  in the
    template if the pam parsing option in turned on.
  * $ENV{RELEASE} is now initialized every time a check is run on the
    template. Information can come from three sources, the kernel
    version returned from a selected kernel in the main section, the
    user defined kernel version in the ABS, or `uname -r`.  User defined
    kernel version overrides the kernel.  The root_fs needs to be built
    in relation to the actual kernel  modules it will run on.
    Previously the $RELEASE value wasn't returned  properly because of
    some bugs in kernel_version_check.  This has been fixed.
  * The proper ldd check is now used if a dynamically linked binary is
    detected to require uClibc rather than libc6.  The ldd from the
    default location of  /usr/i386-linux-uclibc/bin is used for uClibc.
    The old behavior of automatically including the default loader for
    the host system has  been removed.
  * Fixed pam test so that the 3rd field rather than the 4th field is
    being  checked in the service-name files found in /etc/pam.d/.  The
    4th field is  acceptable for pam.conf.  If a path is specified in
    either conf format,  that path will be checked, otherwise, either
    the pam default path of  /usr/lib/security or the FSSTD location
    /lib/security will be checked  for a match.
  * Fixed nss test so that it checks for the right
    libnss_(service).so.$version if glibc 2.2 is used.  Glibc 2.0 and
    2.1 used 1 and 2 respectively, but 2.2 uses 2.
  * Experimental busybox and uClibc functionality included for boot_fs.
  * Many improvements to the verbosity output.
  * Replacements path is set just once.
  * The Path Box only allowed extra paths to be added before the first
    generation  of a root_fs creation, this was because the values
    weren't allowed to be  changed after they were defined.  This has
    been fixed.
  * Symlinks have been vastly improved.  Fictional or real links can now
    be  specified, and links always follow the link -> (file | directory
    ) format  where either side can be existing dirs/files or fictional
    dirs/files on the  system.
  * All of Tom's templates have been replaced with new templates clearly
    marked as Examples.
  * Example.yard takes advantage of the automated NSS and PAM feature,
    and can  create a devfs or nondevfs root filesystem, and has many
    new replacements.   The inittabs reflect modern versions of dpkg,
    rpm, and slackware based  distributions.
  * Example-Mini.yard demonstrates the bare minimum required to create a
    working root_fs.
  * The documentation in the new templates has been improved  to respect
    the way gbootroot's Yard now works, since it has been greatly
    modified from the original, and some old features deemed unnecessary
    have been removed.
  * The Debian.yard example has had a name change to Example-
    Debian.yard, and has additional documentation so the user
    understands its prerequisites. The FAQ covers make_debian usage.
  * Chrooted tests in the Yard Box are disabled and removed when a non-
    root  user runs the box.
  * ARS and YardBox error handling is much better because $error has
    been made private, before it was mostly global in YardBox.pm which
    meant an error value remained ERROR even when the problem was fixed
    which caused the YardBox to fail to work properly after certain
    errors.
  * When the ARS hadn't been opened yet, the program reported that the
    root device hadn't been umounted yet, this was observed with
    genext2fs but was certainly a global bug.  This has been fixed.
  * The majority of add-on replacements except for passwd*, shadow, and
    ld.so.conf have a CVS Id and "make_debian replacement".
  * Original CVS information is now preserved so that non-root users and
    root can't edit global replacements, the basic idea  is that root
    will usually be using an editor like Emacs in
    $HOME/.gbootroot/yard/Replacements which respects that CVS versioned
    files  outside of the repository are read-only (essentially because
    the date has  changed).  Users should make copies of versioned
    replacements which they  want to edit, for instance: fstab.debian-
    1000  Also, they shouldn't defeat the mechanism by removing the CVS
    directories, although, only root has write permissions.
  * All replacements are now symlinks which is helpful to maintain
    static  information for add-ons, anotherwards, this allows the
    author to know that  all his replacements are updated in user
    workspaces when he releases a new  add-on.  Because of this change
    symlinks will now be respected in the  Replacements directory since
    the file being pointed to will be used instead  of the actual link
    when constructing the root filesystem.
  * Non-root users may now create boot disks.  Boot Loaders may required
    root  permissions for some methods, and the fstab may need to be
    edited, see FAQ.   And some /lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules  may
    need to be given world read  permissions.
  * A dialog box has been added which will pop up when the lilo stage
    has been  reached for a normal user, explaining the requirements,
    and what the user  can do next which is explained in detail in the
    FAQ.
  * Non-root users may now create root filesystems up to 8192k in size
    using genext2fs.  FAQ explains how to exceed this limit as a normal
    user.
  * Added sources.list replacement.
  * Added /swapfile to fstab.debian.

gbootroot (1.2.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Append field in the ABS now saves state for non-root users.  Before it only
    remembered state if lilo.conf could actually be read, ofcourse, this wasn't
    an option for non-root users.  The beginnings of non-root boot and root_fs
    creation capabilities have been put into place, but haven't been fully
    implemented.  The end result of this is that directories created in
    $tmp are now static for non-root users and now use the userid number to 
    keep track of different non-root users.

  * The author of swim came out with a new version he now calls dswim.  This
    means Debian System Wide Information Manager, but the "d" could also stand 
    for different.  Changes have been made to make_debian to facilitate this 
    much more stable version of swim, and better non-installed package checks 
    have been implemented in make_debian.

  * The control dependencies have been vastly improved, and reflect the change
    from swim to dswim.  Yard_chrooted_tests is now put in a gbootroot specific
    directory since it is unique to gbootroot.

  * The lastest user-mode-linux is included: 2.4.12

  * Updated the documentation, and it includes a better explanation in step 7
    for "How can I test gBootRoot?"

  * Added checks for the existence of ash, lilo, bzip2, and file for the 2 
    disk compression method.
