Program:  gBootRoot  pronounced "bOOtrOOt"
License:  GNU General Public License

The Makefile included with this source package doesn't attempt
to figure out whether your system has the proper requirements.
It may seem like a great idea to have a configure script, but
these things can fail, besides gbootroot is a program designed for people
who intend to build distributions and boot disks, so understanding what
things are required to get gbootroot to work completely can be quite 
beneficial.  At the very least, do a "make", and try gbootroot because the 
program will tell you what things are missing - hopefully nothing - and then 
you can refer to this README for help.

Out of the box this program works with the i386 architecture, people using
other architectures will need to compile genext2fs and user-mode-linux if
they want full functionality.


Perl Modules:
#############

Gtk-Perl
--------

Version 0.7002 or greater.
http://freshmeat.net/projects/gtk-perl


Binaries:
#########  

Genext2fs
---------
genext2fs/genext2fs (included and already compiled for i386)
cd genext2fs; make  (other architectures)

User-Mode-Linux
---------------
user-mode-linux/usr/bin/{linux, uml_*}  (included and already compiled 
		                                              for i386)
user-mode-linux/usr/lib/{modules*tar}   (included and already compiled 
                                                              for i386)

If you use a different architecture you will need to get kernel source
from www.kernel.org, and then a matching uml-patch from 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=429.  There's good 
instructions on how to do this at 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/UserModeLinux-HOWTO-2.html.
Then put the uml kernel and helpers in the appropriate directory; you can
put the modules in a Replacements directory later on (see FAQ).


Boot Methods:
#############

2 disk compression
------------------

This method will tell you when any of these utilities are missing:

ash  lilo  bzip2  file


Root Methods:
#############

Yard
----

Watch the verbosity box, it will be obvious when a required command is missing.
Make sure you have this file installed on your system:

file


Important Configurations:
#########################

"chmod 4755 /usr/bin/uml_net" so normal users can have network capabilities.


Documentation:
#############

Documentaion and FAQ is in doc/html/index.html


Have fun!
