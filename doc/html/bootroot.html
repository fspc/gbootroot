You found it&nbsp;..&nbsp; the BootRoot page.&nbsp;&nbsp;Check out the <a href="/">gBootRoot</a> page, I no longer actively maintain BootRoot because the graphical version is much more powerful!
<p>
<p>
<h3>The four steps to making a Boot Root set.</h3>
1).&nbsp;&nbsp;Grab the Perl Script right here&nbsp;..&nbsp;<a href="http://gbootroot.sourceforge.net/boot_root.4">boot_root</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;give it a name .. umm .. boot_root.
<br><br>
2).&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure the bang line points to the right place. 
<pre>
      $ which perl
      /usr/bin/perl
      $ grep "perl -w" boot_root
      #!/usr/bin/perl -w 
</pre>
<br>
3).&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it executable.
<pre>
      $ chmod 755 boot_root
</pre>
<br>
4).&nbsp;&nbsp;Put it in one of your LIB PATHS.
<pre>
      $ echo $PATH
      /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:.:
      $ mv boot_root /usr/bin
</pre>
<br>
5).&nbsp;&nbsp;Run it, and have lots of fun!&nbsp;&nbsp;More directions can be found at the beginning of the script.

<h3>BootRoot FAQ </h3>
<p> <b> What does this program do?</b>  
<p>
  BootRoot creates a boot disk with lilo, a kernel and an initrd image.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;The initrd script mounts another root disk with a compressed (gzip or 
  bzip2) filesystem.
<p>
  The root filesystem isn't made by this program, but there lots of compressed filesytems out there to use (see rest of FAQ).&nbsp;&nbsp;  This program is 
  patterned after mkrboot, but unlike <a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/admin/mkrboot">mkrboot</a> it creates an unique bootdisk
  and a separate root disk.
<p>
  <b>What's the advantage of using this program?</b>
<p>
  You can use a bzip2 compressed filesystem, this program is
  easy to use, and it provides a framework showing a simple initrd method 
  which you can freely modify.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote this 
  program as a solution to help oster at EE (www.experts-exchange.com) 
  create separate boot and root floppies for an emergency system for his 
  customers.
<p>
  If you make a cool change to this program, or if this program helps you 
  I'd love to know, that's better than receiving pizza :)
<p>
  <b>How can I test BootRoot?</b> 
<p>
  Get SETUP.GZ as the filesystem from looplinux at 
  <a href="http://www.tux.org/pub/people/kent-robotti/index.html">looplinux</a> or get it <a href="/bootroot/setup.gz">here</a>.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;This filesystem works with 2.2 kernels.
<p>    
  [Ctrl] ([Tab] to see available images) 
<br>  boot: bootdisk single [Enter]
<br>  ( now filesystem is single user mode)
<br>  exit [Enter]
<br>  (now you are in multi user mode)
<p>
 Better yet, do [Ctrl]
<br> boot: bootdisk 2 [Enter]
<p>
 This works nicely with a compressed root filesystems made with <a href="http://www.croftj.net/~fawcett/yard/">yard</a> without "single" .. but looplinux 
comes with <a href="http://www.tw.gnome.org/mc/announce.html">mc (mcedit)</a>.

<p>
<b>Why doesn't looplinux work as "bootdisk 1?"</b>
<p>
  There is a difference between "1" and "single."&nbsp;&nbsp;Looplinux was written
  in a way that runlevel 1 doesn't work properly in relation to BootRoot
  unless single is used.  &nbsp;&nbsp;And you thought they were the same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  BootRoot proves otherwise.

<p>
  <b>What sort of configuration can I do?</b>
<p>
  Edit the variable $compress to either gzip (default) or bzip2. 
<p>
  <b>How do I use the program?</b>
<p>


  program_name&nbsp;&nbsp; lilo&nbsp;&nbsp; linux-kernel&nbsp;&nbsp; compressed-filesystem
<p>
  "lilo" is the only method supported at the present.
<p>
Example:
<br>
  "linux-kernel" could be:  /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.14  
<br>                  "compressed-filesystem" could be:  /home/createit/my_creation.gz
<br>  (if found in same directory when running the program)
<br>                  "linux-kernel could be":  vmlinuz-2.2.14
<br>                  "compressed-filesystem" could be:  my_creation.gz
<h3>Old versions of BootRoot.</h3>
None available.
