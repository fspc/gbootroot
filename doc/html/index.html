<b>How to Use gBootRoot</b></P>
<P><IMG ALT="" SRC="images/gBS.jpg" align="right">The most important button to 
familiarize yourself with is the Submit button which starts the whole process;
dialogs are presented as the process continues asking you if you want to 
continue &quot;OK&quot; or stop &quot;Cancel&quot;.</P>

<p>
The <u>first row</u> presently has only one Boot Method choice:
"2 disk compression."&nbsp;&nbsp
Clicking on the menu on the right selects the Boot Method.</p>


<P>The <u>second row</u> allows you to select the kernel for the Boot/Root set.&nbsp;&nbsp;  You 
may either use the file selector button on the right hand side, or you may 
type in the location on the left hand side.</P>

<P>
The <u>third row</u> allows you to select the compressed filesystem you are
providing, using either of the two ways mentioned before. &nbsp;&nbsp;  You may use a
pre-made root filesystem or you may create one using one of the Methods 
provided in the Advanced Root Section.
</P>


<P>The <u>fourth row</u> allows you to select the device you want to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The default
device is the first floppy disk - /dev/fd0.</P>

<p>
The <u>fifth row</u> allows you to choose the size of the device being used. &nbsp;&nbsp;
The default size of 1440 assumes you are using a floppy drive (Note: You may 
want to experiment with 1722 which works fine with many floppy drives.), but
can be used with other sized devices like tape drives.  &nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the 
appropriate radio button to choose either gzip or bzip2 compression if the 
program doesn't automatically detect it.</p>

<P align="center"><b>Verbosity Box</b></p>
<IMG ALT="" SRC="images/verbosity_box.jpg" align="right">

The <u>slider bar</u> on the right allows the output of the verbosity box 
to be 
changed from the highest (2) to the lowest setting (1) or to be turned off (0)
or on again.&nbsp;&nbsp;
At times it may be advantageous to turn off the verbosity box 
since large quantities of output to this box may cause gbootroot to use too 
much cpu power; however, output may still be found in the text file "verbose" 
in /tmp/gbootroot_tmp'time-date'.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p><P align="center"><b>
Using the Advanced Boot Section</b></p>

<p><IMG ALT="" SRC="images/ABS.jpg" align="right">

"Stripping"&nbsp;&nbsp;  On by default for libraries and binaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The stripping 
behavior for libraries may be changed by clicking on the right mouse button 
to change from --strip-debug to --strip-all.</p>

<p>

"Devel Device"&nbsp;&nbsp; If the device used for development is different than the 
actual boot device, use this field to indicate that device.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will have to 
run lilo -v -C brlilo.conf -r "device mount point" manually at a later time 
on the actual boot device.</p>

<p>

"Opt. Device"&nbsp;&nbsp; Add devices to the boot disk which are necessary for the
kernel to function properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
Put a space between each device.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
For instance, /dev/fb0 for frame buffer devices.</p>

<p>

"Kernel Module"&nbsp;&nbsp; Add the modules found in 
/lib/modules/kernel-version which are necessary for the Boot Method to work
properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If these modules aren't found here it is assumed that they either
are in the kernel or they do not exist.</p>

<p>

"append ="&nbsp;&nbsp;  Add append options to brlilo.conf.&nbsp;&nbsp;  If you are using a frame
buffer device you could add something like video=matrox:vesa:402,depth:16.</p>

<b>Using the Advanced Root Section</b></P>
<p><IMG ALT="" SRC="images/ARS.jpg" align="right">

"Root Device"&nbsp;&nbsp;  
This is the device used for the root filesystem when 
constructing the Boot/Root set.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
You may choose a device which is different 
than the Boot device, but presently only floppy devices are supported.</p>

<p>

"Root Device Size"&nbsp;&nbsp; The size of the actual media used for the Root Device.</p>

<p>

"Root Filename"&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The name give to the root filesystem when initially made
in the temporary creation location.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The save button allows the creation to
be saved in the permanent default location when the 
Accept button is pressed.</p>

<p>

"Filesystem Size"&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Root Methods make the filesystem the size which is 
specified here.</p>

<p>

"Compression"&nbsp;&nbsp;
Off by default to allow user-mode-linux testing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn on 
compression when you are ready to use a Boot Method 
which requires compression.</p>

<p>

"Method"&nbsp;&nbsp; The root filesystem creation method.</p>

<p>

"Template"&nbsp;&nbsp; The template associated with a Root Method.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Not all Root Methods
have templates.</p>

<p>

"Generate"&nbsp;&nbsp; This puts the chosen Root Method in action.</p>

<p>

"UML"&nbsp;&nbsp; Abbreviation for user-mode-linux. &nbsp;&nbsp;
 This is a linux kernel which runs on
top of the host system's linux kernel and allows a you run a live root 
filesystem.</p>

<p>  

"Accept"&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This accepts the created root filesystem if it is found in the 
temporary creation directory.  &nbsp;&nbsp;
The UML box and the main section will now 
reflect the path to this root filesystem. &nbsp;&nbsp;
 You can now test with the UML 
button or a put together a complete Boot/Root set with the Submit button.</p>

<p><P align="center"><b>User Mode Linux Box</b></p>

<p><IMG ALT="" SRC="images/uml_box.jpg" align="right">

"Xterm"&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose an xterm with its executable options switch.</p>

<p>

"Options"&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter uml command-line options like: mem=64, 
devfs=nomount.</p>

<p>

"Root_Fs"&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose an uncompressed root filesystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Append with ubd?=.</p>

<p>

"Abort"&nbsp;&nbsp; Abort user-mode-linux kernel processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

About the Yard Box</b></p>

<p><IMG ALT="" SRC="images/yard_box.jpg" align="center"></p>

The Yard Box is a Root Method which is "Generated" from the Advanced Root
Section after a Template is chosen.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It has several interesting features.

<p>

The check boxes at the bottom represent the different stages involved in
creating a root filesystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The behavior of these stages may be altered in
three ways: Edit->Stages->one-by-one (default) will perform each stage
sequentially, stopping between each stage, the user may continue the process
by pressing the Continue button. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Edit->Stages->continuous proceeds non-stop
through all the stages.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Edit->Stages->'user defined' allows the user to
choose any stages the user wants, and will then proceed through all the
chosen stages.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Choosing only 'Check', 'Links & Deps', 'Create" is a good 
example.</p>  

<p><IMG ALT="" SRC="images/tests.jpg" align="center"></p>

<p>

The behavior of some of the stages may be altered.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
For instance Alt-T allows
you to choose which tests to run on the newly created 
root filesystem.</p>

<p><IMG ALT="" SRC="images/template_search.jpg" align="center"></p>

<p>

Press Alt-S to enable template text searching in either
direction.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Find exact matches or ignore case with the case sensitive check
box.</p>

<p><IMG ALT="" SRC="images/file.jpg" align="center"></p>

<p>

Use Ctl-S to save the changes to an open template, and Alt-A to save the
template with a new name.&nbsp;&nbsp;
bOOTrOOT will not allow read-only templates or template links to be saved
with their own name.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A few of these example files are included.  &nbsp;&nbsp;
You may make changes to them or clear their buffers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then you may save the template with a 
different name.</p>

<p><IMG ALT="" SRC="images/stripping.jpg" align="center"></p>

<p>

Edit->Settings->Stripping allows you to turn off/on stripping for
Libraries, Binaries, and Modules.&nbsp;&nbsp;
--strip-all is the default stripping
behavior, but Libraries may have this behavior changed to --strip-debug.</p>


<p><IMG ALT="" SRC="images/paths.jpg" align="center"></p>

<p>

Edit->Setting->Paths allows you to prepend a new search path to your 
environments $PATH variable.
</p>

<p><IMG ALT="" SRC="images/filesystem.jpg" align="center"></p>

<p>

Edit->'File System" may alter the type of filesystem used to make the root
filesystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
Because the filesystem is created on a loop device, some 
filesystem types may complain or not be created at all.</p>

<p><IMG ALT="" SRC="images/replacements.jpg" align="center"></p>

<p>

Edit->Replacements in your $HOME/.gbootroot/Replacements directory using
an editor of your choice.
</p>

<p><IMG ALT="" SRC="images/create.jpg" align="center"></p>

<p>

Create->Replacements creates special replacement files.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Presently it creates 
an fstab configuration file as Replacements/etc/fstab.new in 
$HOME/.gbootroot/yard/.</p>

<P>Little things you may want to know:</P>

<P>* gBootRoot requires ash for initrd.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ash is a feather weight version of Bash.</P>
<br>

<P><IMG ALT="" SRC="images/gBSicon.jpg" align="center"> <b>FAQ</b></P>
<P><b>What does the 2 disk compression method do?</b></P>
<P>This Boot Method creates a boot disk with lilo, a kernel and an initrd 
image.&nbsp;&nbsp;   The 
initrd script mounts another root disk with a compressed (gzip or bzip2) 
filesystem.</P>

<P><b>What's the advantage of using this program?</b></P>

<P>You can use a bzip2 compressed filesystem, this program is easy to use, and it provides a framework showing a simple initrd method which you can freely 
modify.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I wrote this program as an extension to BootRoot which was written 
as a solution to help oster at EE (www.experts-exchange.com) create separate 
boot and root floppies for an emergency system for his customers.</P>

<P><A href="./bootroot.html">BootRoot</A> 
was the original program, but it was decided that a GUI approach
provided the user much more versatility and power in creating distributions.
</P>

<P>If you make a cool change to this program, or if this program helps you I'd love to know, that's better than receiving pizza. :)</P>

<P><b>How can I test gBootRoot?</b></P>

<P>1.  Download 
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/user-mode-linux/root_fs_tomrtbt_1.7.205.bz2">
root_fs_tomrtbt_1.7.205.bz2</a> at Sourceforge.</p> 


<p>  

2.  
[Ctrl] ([Tab] to see available images) 
<br>  boot: bootdisk single [Enter]
<br>  ( now filesystem is single user mode)
<br>  exit [Enter]
<br>  (now you are in multi user mode)
<p>
 Better yet, do [Ctrl]
<br> boot: bootdisk 2 [Enter]

<P><b>Why doesn't looplinux work as &quot;bootdisk 1?&quot;</b></P>
<P>There is a difference between &quot;1&quot; and &quot;single.&quot;  Looplinux was written in a 
way that runlevel 1 doesn't work properly in relation to gBootRoot unless 
single is used.&nbsp;&nbsp;   And you thought they were the same thing?&nbsp;&nbsp;   gBootRoot 
proves otherwise. </P>

<P><b>gBootRoot doesn't start because it can't locate Gtk.pm?</b></P>
<p>This program requires Gtk-Perl available from <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN">CPAN</a>, <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/gtk-perl">Freshmeat</a> or most GNU/Linux distributions.</p>

<p><b>There isn't enough room left on my 1440 floppy to make a Boot or Root
disk.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any way to free up more space apart from reducing 
the size of the kernel?</b></p>

<p>
Move the device size to 1722.  This is a trick that <a href="http://www.toms.net/rb/">tomsrtbt</a> uses on his famous rescue disk.</p>

<p><b>If you roll the floppy density counter down to 0 and then try go back 
up towards 1440 and 1722, you get very funny figures.</b></p>

<p>
This is because of the way Gtk works.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two adjustments, 
step and page increments.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you press your first mouse button the step 
has been set to 282 so that a person can easily switch between 1440 and 1722.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;When you use your second mouse button the page is set at 360.  You can go 
down to zero by pressing your third mouse button on the down arrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now 
page up with the second button to 1440 and step with the first button to 
1722.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pretty cool, eh?</p>
