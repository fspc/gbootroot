# The Lazy Guy's packaging tool for gBootRoot.
# This program sets-up the archive which will be turned into a package and 
# needs to be run as root.  The advantage of this program is that the 
# archive will always represent the Makefile which is being tested
# when development isn't being done with perl -I . ./gbootroot.
# This program can be adapted for other packages.

# This program uses dh-make, and copies your own defaults to 
# $packaging_place/debian from your $packaging_defaults, and updates
# to the proper date/times and data in changelog and copyright.  
# After this debuild from devscripts (this uses lintian) runs. 
# Now all you do is finish stuff off with dpkg-scanpackages ..
# something like this:
# dpkg-scanpackages . override | gzip > Packages.gz

# User defined variables for directories and package
# Makefile.pkg in $gbootroot_cvs in used as the packages Makefile.
