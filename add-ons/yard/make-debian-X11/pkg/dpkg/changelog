make-debian-x11 (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The author of swim came out with a new version he now calls dswim.  This
    means Debian System Wide Information Manager, but the "d" could also stand 
    for different.  Changes have been made to make_debian to facilitate this 
    much more stable version of swim, and better non-installed package checks 
    have been implemented in make_debian.

  * Where to edit the script is now more obvious to the non-programmer.

  * The dependencies have been updated to reflect the change from swim to dswim.
