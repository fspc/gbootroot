make-debian-x11 (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * setup-debian-X11 script improved slightly.
  * The majority of replacements except for passwd*, shadow, and
    ld.so.conf have Id and made by make_debian.  Since non-root users
    can't edit global replacements, the basic idea is that root won't
    edit replacements either,  because usually root will be using an
    editor like Emacs which respects  that CVS versioned files outside
    of the repository are read-only.  Users should make copies of
    versioned replacements which they want to edit: fstab.debian-1000

make-debian-x11 (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The author of swim came out with a new version he now calls dswim.  This
    means Debian System Wide Information Manager, but the "d" could also stand 
    for different.  Changes have been made to make_debian to facilitate this 
    much more stable version of swim, and better non-installed package checks 
    have been implemented in make_debian.

  * Where to edit the script is now more obvious to the non-programmer.

  * The dependencies have been updated to reflect the change from swim to dswim.
