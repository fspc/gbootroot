1.2 - 12/07/2001
----------------

setup-debian-X11 script improved slightly.

The majority of replacements except for passwd*, shadow, and ld.so.conf have
Id and made by make_debian.  Since non-root users can't edit global
replacements, the basic idea is that root won't edit replacements either, 
because usually root will be using an editor like Emacs which respects 
that CVS versioned files outside of the repository are read-only.  Users
should make copies of versioned replacements which they want to edit:
fstab.debian-1000

1.1 - 10/23/2001
----------------

The author of swim came out with a new version he now calls dswim.  This
means Debian System Wide Information Manager, but the "d" could also stand
for different.  Changes have been made to make_debian to facilitate this
much more stable version of swim, and better non-installed package checks
have been implemented in make_debian.

Where to edit the script is now more obvious to the non-programmer.

The dependencies have been updated to reflect the change from swim to dswim.
