Setting up the root filesystem
-----------------------------

1. Run setup in this directory: 

. setup

Setting up a Swap File
----------------------

1. Run make_swapfile in this directory:

. make_swapfile


Getting X working
-----------------

1. To get X11 working you will need to get your network up.  The instructions
below assume your host (the computer you are running) has an ip of 192.168.1.4,
a uml ip of 192.168.1.2 and a tap device ip of 192.168.1.5.

2.  You may need to give X server access control for the uml instance by 
typing this on your host machine: xhost +192.168.1.2

3. If you haven't already done this, you will want to edit the 
/etc/network/interfaces file using vi.  This should be self-explanatory.

4. You don't need to load any modules required by your host system, because
uml_net will cause the modules to be loaded automatically - assuming your 
kernel has kmod -  when it automatically configures the tap device interface 
for ethertap.  But if you want or need to do it manually from your host 
system, you could do something like this:

 modprobe ethertap
 modprobe netlink_dev
 ifconfig tap0 192.168.1.5
 route add -host 192.168.1.4 gw 192.168.1.5

5. The next time you start the uml kernel and boot the root_fs you will want 
to give it options like this where  HWaddr (see ifconfig) belongs to your 
network device:

 ubd0=/root_fs_debian_x11 root=/dev/ubd0 eth0=ethertap,tap0,HWaddr,192.168.1.5 mem=64M

6.  At this point you should be able to ping 192.168.1.4.

Hint:  Check to make sure that uml_net came bundled with the uml kernel,
because this is what enables networking, and make sure it is setuid root
(chmod 4755).

7.  Run startx.  It will ask for your host ip number.

That's it.

Hints:
Mount the host fs:  mount -t hostfs none /mnt
		    mount -t hostfs none -o /home /mnt
